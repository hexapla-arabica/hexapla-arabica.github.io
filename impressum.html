	  <br><br><b>[2]</b> Six wooden panels [<a href="image3.jpg" target="_blank">image</a>]: © Jakub Zbrzeżny. Based on photographs taken by Jakub Zbrzeżny at the Rockefeller Archaeological Museum in East Jerusalem in summer 2023. The photographs depict six wooden panels, which, according to the Museum, originate from al-Aqsa Mosque, are dated to the eight century CE, and represent Byzantine (Christian) artistic style. The panels on the image were arranged by Jakub Zbrzeżny (with no bearing on their original arrangement) and presented in black&white with high contrast and soft edges, with the use of Microsoft PowerPoint and without the use of Generative AI.
