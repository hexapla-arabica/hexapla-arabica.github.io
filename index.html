  <p>
    <strong>Hexapla Arabica</strong> is a living mosaic of people, texts, images, and sounds centred on Arabic expressions of the Scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – great monuments of world literature. <br><br>Spanning the written and the spoken, across the wide linguistic spectrum of Arabic, from classical to colloquial, the network creates an intellectual space where all strands of Arabic are equally appreciated. This enables us to explore their inner dialogue, illuminating Scriptural meaning in the distant past and today.

      The network is inspired by the groundbreaking research conducted by Origen, a biblical scholar based in Caesarea on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean in the early third century CE. Origen worked on Hebrew and Greek versions of the Scriptures that circulated in his time. He and his team created a handwritten comparative edition of the Bible that was arranged in six parallel columns, hence “hexapla” in ancient Greek, meaning “sixfold”.<br><br> The columns represented different and yet closely related versions of the text as transmitted by both Jews and Christians. These versions have been shedding light on one another ever since. Never canonised by any Church, despite tortures he endured for his faith during Roman persecutions, Origen remains a saint of biblical scholarship to this day.<br><br> So-called “non-canonical” varieties of Arabic are cherished within our network: from Judeo-Arabic, to Christian Arabic, to Arabic dialects. Equally, we value the devoted readers of the Arabic Jewish and Christian Bibles and the Qurʾān, whom “canonical scholarship” rarely engages in conversation: Arabic-speaking men and women from rural and urban communities of the Scriptural heartland across Israel and Palestine today. <br><br>The network contributes to protecting their distinct voices from gradually disappearing under the standardising pressures of Arabic Large Language Models in the first half of the twenty-first century.<br><br> The Hexapla Arabica network has been established with a long-term mission – as long as there are researchers and learners, writers and readers, performers and listeners, who care about the linguistic mosaic of Arabic language, ancient and modern alike, we will be here to work with and support them.<br><br> As we pursue our mission in the coming years we are excited to build partnerships with individuals and organisations which share our vision for the innovative study of Arabic - from philanthropists interested in supporting new horizons in research to scholars and students interested in collaboration, we are looking forward to hearing from you.
