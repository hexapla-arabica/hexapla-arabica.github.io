  <div class="intro">
    <p><strong>Hexapla Arabica</strong> is a mosaic-like network of humans, texts, images, and sounds centred on Arabic expressions of the Scriptures of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam – monuments of world literature – in their written and oral manifestations across the wide linguistic spectrum of Arabic: from Classical Arabic to Colloquial Arabic. The network creates an intellectual space where various strands of Arabic are equally appreciated, allowing for their inner dialogue, illuminating the Scriptural meaning in the distant past and today.<br><br>
	As indicated by its name, the network is inspired by the groundbreaking research conducted in Late Antiquity by Origen, a biblical scholar based in Caesarea on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean in the early third century CE. Origen worked on Hebrew and Greek versions of the Scriptures that circulated in his time. Centuries before the invention of print and even more centuries before the digital revolution, he and his team created a handwritten comparative edition of the Bible that was arranged in six parallel columns (hence “hexapla” in ancient Greek, which means “sixfold”). The columns represented different and yet closely related versions of the text as transmitted by both Jews and Christians. These versions have been shedding light on one another ever since. Never canonised by any Church, despite tortures he endured for his faith during Roman persecutions, Origen remains a saint of biblical scholarship to this day.<br><br>
	Seemingly “non-canonical” varieties of Arabic are also cherished within the network: from Judeo-Arabic, to Christian Arabic, to Arabic dialects. So too are the devoted readers of the Arabic Jewish and Christian Bibles and the Qurʾān, whom “canonical scholarship” rarely engages in conversation: Arabic-speaking men and women from rural and urban communities of the Scriptural heartland across Israel and Palestine today. The network contributes to protecting their distinct voices from gradually disappearing under the standardizing pressures of Arabic Large Language Models in the first half of the twenty-first century.<br><br>
	Unlike long- and short-term “projects”, whose continuity always depends on funding rounds, the Hexapla Arabica network is here to stay – for as long as there are researchers and learners, writers and readers, performers and listeners, supported by businesspeople and philanthropists, as well as professional administrators and IT specialists, who care about the linguistic mosaic of Arabic language, ancient and modern alike.
